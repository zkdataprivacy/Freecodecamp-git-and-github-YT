Git is a version control system which you have on your local machine
Github is a centralized place where you host your repo (project) to collab or share with other people in order to showcase change/update on the project or invite to work on the project. 

Some list of Git commands for quick reference:
    a. git clone: With the help of this command, you can bring hosted repo somewhere like github to your local machine into a folder.
    b. git add: This command track your file and changes in the git.
    c. git commit: You can think of this command as "save button" or like "ctrl+s" to save any changes to your file in git.
    d. git push: This command helps you to push any saved changes in the project to host somewhere like github.
    e. git pull: This command helps you to download any changes made by others to the exisiting project in your local machine or in simple words it syncs any update to the hosted project.
